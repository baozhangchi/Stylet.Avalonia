Introduction
------------

Stylet is a small but powerful ViewModel-first MVVM framework for Avaloinia UI (.NET 4.5+ and .NET Core 3.0+), which allows you to write maintainable and extensible code in a way which is easy to test.
Stylet's aims are to:

 - Solve the blockers, niggles, and annoyances which hamper MVVM development without a framework, using simple but powerful concepts.
 - Be obvious to people picking up your project for the first time: there's very little magic
 - Be easy to verify/validate. The LOC count is low, and it comes with a very comprehensive test suite. The code is well-written and well-documented.
 - Be flexible while providing sensible defaults. Almost any part of the framework can be overridden if you wish, but you probably won't want to.

It is inspired by [Caliburn.Micro](http://caliburnmicro.com/), and shares many of its concepts, but removes most of the magic (replacing it with more powerful alternatives), and simplifies parts considerably by targeting only MVVM and Avaloinia UI .
